# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### Changed

- Command-line usage errors now exit 64. They exited 2 before, which collided with the `blocked` decision. Decision exit codes 0 to 3 are unchanged, and `--help` and `--version` still exit 0.

### Added

- `aurlens::cli::run` hosts the whole command line in the library, so another Rust binary can expose it under its own name. See [Embed the AURLens CLI](docs/embedding.md).
- `aurlens schema review` and `aurlens schema verify` print the JSON Schema of the version 1 reports. The files are in [`schemas/`](schemas).
- The report types implement `Deserialize` and ignore unknown fields. `Change`, `Coverage`, `Evidence`, `FileSummary`, and `Finding` are also exported from the crate root.

The JSON reports and their `schema_version` are unchanged.
